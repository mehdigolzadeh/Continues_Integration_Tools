It should be noted that some CI servers (e.g., **Jenkins**, **Bamboo** and **Hudson**) are also able to deploy software to staging or production environment.
Bamboo and **CruiseControl** maintained the subsequent positions. 
used **TeamCity** as CI server in the pipeline and other CI servers have been reported in one paper each.

They all used CI, and a variety of CI systems, including **Concourse**, **Jenkins**, **TravisCI**, **CruiseControl.NET**, **CircleCI**, **TeamCity**, **XCode Bots**, **Buildbot**, **Wercker**, **appVeyor**, and proprietary CI systems.
