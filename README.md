An abundance of tools are available, from self-hosted systems such as Jenkins, TeamCity, and Bamboo to hosted products like CloudBees and Travis CI. 

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7884954
It should be noted that some CI servers (e.g., **Jenkins**, **Bamboo** and **Hudson**) are also able to deploy software to staging or production environment.
Bamboo and **CruiseControl** maintained the subsequent positions. 
used **TeamCity** as CI server in the pipeline and other CI servers have been reported in one paper each.

https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3655567 -> _FEATURES LISTED_
**Jenkins**, **Teamcity**, **Bamboo**, **Buddy**, **GitLab CI**, **CircleCI**, **Travis**

As a practice, CI is seeing broad adoption with the increasing popularity of the GITHUB pull-based development model [9] and the plethora of open-source, GITHUB-compatible, cloud-based CI tools, such as **TRAVIS CI**, **CLOUDBEES**, and **CIRCLECI**.

They all used CI, and a variety of CI systems, including **Concourse**, **Jenkins**, **TravisCI**, **CruiseControl.NET**, **CircleCI**, **TeamCity**, **XCode Bots**, **Buildbot**, **Wercker**, **appVeyor**, and proprietary CI systems.

only **Travis**

Dedicated CI tools such as BAMBOO,3 JENKINS,4 and TEAMCITY5 emerged to provide basic CI functionality; however, these CI tools still require that infrastructure is internally operated and maintained
