# List of CIs based on publications


[Continuous Integration and Its Tools](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6802994) 

An abundance of tools are available, from self-hosted systems such as Jenkins, TeamCity, and Bamboo to hosted products like CloudBees and Travis CI. 

[Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment: A Systematic Review on Approaches, Tools, Challenges and Practices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7884954) 

It should be noted that some CI servers (e.g., **Jenkins**, **Bamboo** and **Hudson**) are also able to deploy software to staging or production environment.
Bamboo and **CruiseControl** maintained the subsequent positions. 
used **TeamCity** as CI server in the pipeline and other CI servers have been reported in one paper each.

_LISTED FEATURES_ for **Jenkins**, **Teamcity**, **Bamboo**, **Buddy**, **GitLab CI**, **CircleCI**, **Travis**

[The impact of continuous integration on other software development practices: A large-scale empirical study](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8115619) 

As a practice, CI is seeing broad adoption with the increasing popularity of the GITHUB pull-based development model [9] and the plethora of open-source, GITHUB-compatible, cloud-based CI tools, such as **TRAVIS CI**, **CLOUDBEES**, and **CIRCLECI**.

[Trade-offs in continuous integration: assurance, security, and flexibility](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3106237.3106270) 

They all used CI, and a variety of CI systems, including **Concourse**, **Jenkins**, **TravisCI**, **CruiseControl.NET**, **CircleCI**, **TeamCity**, **XCode Bots**, **Buildbot**, **Wercker**, **appVeyor**, and proprietary CI systems.

[Use and Misuse of Continuous Integration Features: An Empirical Study of Projects That (Mis)Use Travis CI](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8360943) 

Dedicated CI tools such as BAMBOO,3 JENKINS,4 and TEAMCITY5 emerged to provide basic CI functionality; however, these CI tools still require that infrastructure is internally operated and maintained
