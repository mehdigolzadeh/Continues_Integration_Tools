## 2 More advanced support for integer arithmetics
* Exception handling like division by zero, Error handling for large int
* Different bases binary, octal, hexadecimal and convert numbers
* modular arthematics

## 3 Supporting real numbers
* Support real numbers with big number
* Support scientific notation
* specify precision
* taking care of division by zero
* Convert number from degree to radians

## 4 Complete GUI

## 5 Support for complex numbers
* Complex numbers and expressions
* Computing the modulus
* Converting between cartesian, polar and exponential forms.

## 6 Supporting Boolean logic
* add support for boolean expressions (e.g., and, or, not, implication, equivalence, xor);

## 7 CLI, REPL and expression parser
* parser with support for prefix postfix notation
* consistant output
* operator precendence

## 9 More kinds of arithmetic operations 
* real number domain: the following functions: logarithm, square root, all trigonometric functions (e.g., sin, cos, tan, their inverses and more), the inverse function (1/x), and support for frequently used constants such as e and Pi.
* For the integer number domain, it would be desirable to implement support for modular arithmetics.
* Sudorandom generator -> int -> 0 and provided number - real -> 0 and 1

## 10 Supporting rational numbers
* support for rational numbers and operations

## 12 Caclulator with memory functionality
* store expresions to reuse it (finite but user defined) memnory size
* log of expression and possibility to reuse it
* multiple undo redo
* save history (saving before closing)
* print history

## 13 Support for function manipulation
* storing and manipulating mathematical functions instead of just numerical values
* optional: draw function
* optional: compute derivative and integral

## 24 Adding conversions of measurement units
* convert units: length measurement between (centi/deci/...)meters/feet/inches/miles/nautical miles/yards. Similar conversions would be for measurement of areas, currency, power, energy, pressure, speed, temperature, time, volume, weight and masses.

## 31 Time computations
* compute time interval (how many hours have elapsed since 18:52)
* Timezones should be taken into account
* Subtraction and addition
